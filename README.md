Nespresso
=========

Description
-----------

A Nespresso coffee pod dispenser, with the ability to print a single dispenser, or multiple dispensers joined as a single unit.

Version 2 was a little too tight, version 3 should work better.

Instructions
------------

Tweak OpenSCAD files and generate STL, or use one of the existing STLs provided for 1, 2, 3 or 4 dispensers. Convert to gcodes and send to your 3D printer.

Once printed, the coffee pod cardboard tubes should be opened in the usual way, cutting the lid off at the point where it folds. Insert tube into the dispenser.

Please note that in order for the STLs to display the right way around for Thingiverse, I rotated the final image 180Â°, if you are using the .scad file you will notice that the image loads the other way around. Can't quite imagine why I designed it back to front, but can't see it matters.
